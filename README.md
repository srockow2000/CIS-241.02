"Fantasy is escapist, and that is its glory.
If a soldier is imprisioned by the enemy, don't we consider it his duty to escape?
. . .
If we value the freedom of mind and soul, if we're partisans of liberty,
then it's our plain duty to escape, and to take as many people with us as we can!"

- J. R. R. Tolkien
