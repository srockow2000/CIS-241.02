Discussion points:

* Using Unity
Nobody knows how to use Unity. After taking a cursory look into Unity, the team is willing to try to learn and use Unity to create the project.

* Distributing roles/work
While the team is familiarizing themselves with Unity, the team will work together. Although the work may be redundant, the team will later split up to create and test code once members are familiar with Unity and their roles.

* Identifying functional and non-functional requirements
The team will isolate specific features that they believe should be included in the project along with the essential requirements. 


Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Make a Unity account and watch basic Unity tutorials - entire team
* Research Unity testing - entire team 
* Refresh C# knowledge - entire team
